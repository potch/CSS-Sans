"The Font You Shouldn't Use"

This is a toy project I'm working on to make a display typeface made entirely out of CSS. 
I know what you're thinking- yes, this is a stupid and awful idea, but a fun mental calisthenic.

Contributions welcome!

The Rules
---------
- Each character must be a single dom node, augmented with its :before and :after
- Use borders whenever possible (see below)
- Pull requests preferred to "where's this character?" questions :)

TODO
----
- Capitals, numerals, punctuation
√ Make every stroke made of a border, so it can be colored with border-color
- consolidate kerning rules
√ split up into css file, js, html harness
- plug into `lettering.js <http://letteringjs.com/>`_
